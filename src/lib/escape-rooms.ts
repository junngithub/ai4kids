/**
 * Sample AI Escape Rooms for the kids learning portal.
 *
 * Each room is a little *scene* you explore: a character walks up to clickable
 * objects ("stations"), and each object triggers a short, kid-friendly,
 * educational puzzle. Solve every object's puzzle to unlock the door and escape.
 *
 * Themes are simplified from the AI Vault escape-room project
 * (junngithub/escaperooms) — AI basics, data & patterns, and AI ethics / online
 * safety — re-pitched for ages 7–12.
 *
 * Content is fully static (no AI/API at play time). Each room maps 1:1 to a row
 * in the `activities` table via `activitySlug` (see scripts/seed-portal.ts) and
 * to a route at /learn/escape-room/<slug>.
